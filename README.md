# Instagram Clone

It is a simle Instagram clone where you can create your own profile and share photos with everyone.  
The sole purpose of creating it was to learn and get a good grasp on **Ruby on Rails**.

If you wish to try it, here are some guide lines.
### PreRequisites
```
Ruby Version ~2.5.1
Rails Version ~4.2.10	
```

### Steps
1. Run `$ bundle install` on your terminal to install all the Gems
2. Run `$ rails db:migrate` to set up the data base
3. Run `$ bin/rails server`

This will initialize a localhost server where the program will be up and running.
